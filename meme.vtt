05:55.260 --> 06:02.820
Kizumonogatari Part 1: Blood and Iron

08:15.130 --> 08:16.740
Umm...

08:16.740 --> 08:19.830
I-I didn't see anything...

08:24.290 --> 08:25.790
B L A C K

08:24.290 --> 08:25.790
B L A C K

08:37.070 --> 08:38.500
Ehehe...

08:45.490 --> 08:50.350
Well...

08:50.350 --> 08:54.240
No matter how you think of them, skirts have pretty low security when it comes to hiding things you don’t want others to see.

08:54.240 --> 08:59.370
I guess I would need a firewall like spats?

08:59.370 --> 09:01.480
I guess...

09:12.050 --> 09:16.100
Well, I’ll be leaving now.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.320
Hey, wait a sec!

09:33.690 --> 09:35.430
I’ve finally caught up with you. 

09:36.380 --> 09:38.390
You walk pretty quickly,

09:39.530 --> 09:41.030
Araragi.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.920
Why do you know my name?

09:51.920 --> 09:54.420
Eh? Well, of course I would. 

09:54.420 --> 09:56.550
We go to the same school.

09:58.330 --> 10:06.580
Written with the ‘a’ (‘阿’) that’s the ‘ka’
\(‘可’) from ‘kanou’ (可能 / possibility), two ‘ra’s (‘良’) from ‘ii ko’ (良い子 / good kid), and the ‘gi’ (‘木’) from ‘jumoku’ (樹木 / trees and shrubs). 

09:58.330 --> 10:11.100
fuck this i cant give enough fucks to change this

10:06.580 --> 10:11.530
And your first name would be ‘koyomi’ (‘暦’) from ‘toshitsuki no koyomi’ (年月の暦 / the yearly calendar), right? 

10:11.530 --> 10:14.150
So it's Araragi Koyomi.

10:18.050 --> 10:22.280
And you are Hanekawa.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.970
Hanekawa Tsubasa.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.370
wow fam desu

10:27.990 --> 10:29.750
B L A C K

10:27.990 --> 10:29.750
B L A C K

10:34.510 --> 10:38.780
Amazing! You know the name
of someone like me!

10:38.780 --> 10:41.360
At the final test of the first semester of the second year, 

10:41.360 --> 10:45.010
in all subjects, physical education and visual arts included,

10:45.010 --> 10:47.710
you got wrong only one question in the forms.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.260
that Hanekawa Tsubasa.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.880
FUCK U HERZK I KNOW THIS DOESNT HAVE ANY FLow

10:49.260 --> 10:52.570
Eh? Hey, come on, now!

10:52.570 --> 10:55.050
Why do you know that much?

10:56.170 --> 10:59.150
Could it be that you are...

10:59.150 --> 11:01.720
stalking me?

11:02.740 --> 11:04.310
I have no idea why the fuck did i time this line but might as well keep it

11:02.740 --> 11:04.310
xDDDDDDDd 

11:04.310 --> 11:08.410
Or maybe I'm just too paranoid?

11:08.410 --> 11:09.840
No, not really.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.490
I heard it from my alien friends.

11:13.490 --> 11:15.770
Eh? You have friends?!

11:18.590 --> 11:21.640
Why aren't you questioning the aliens part?!

11:21.640 --> 11:24.660
Well, it's just...

11:24.660 --> 11:29.240
You always leave the impression of a loner, living in solitude.

11:36.010 --> 11:40.120
Well, like you said, I don't really have any friends.

11:40.120 --> 11:46.330
And you are so famous that 
even people without friends know you.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.990
Hey, quit it!

11:48.990 --> 11:52.350
I don't really like this kind of jokes.

11:58.980 --> 12:01.640
Hey, Araragi, 

12:07.090 --> 12:11.230
do you believe in vampires?

12:13.890 --> 12:17.390
What's the matter with vampires?

12:17.390 --> 12:21.900
Well, recently I've been hearing rumors.

12:21.900 --> 12:29.500
Like there's a vampire in the city, so you shouldn't go out alone at night.

12:29.500 --> 12:34.430
That's a big vague, sounds like a baseless rumor.

12:34.430 --> 12:43.870
They say it’s a blonde-haired, beautiful woman
— a vampire whose cold eyes could chill your spine.

12:43.870 --> 12:47.870
But you can’t tell if she’s a vampire just off that, can you?

12:47.870 --> 12:51.650
What if she’s just an ordinary person who stands out because of the blonde hair?

12:52.270 --> 12:58.090
But... I heard that her blonde hair
illuminated by street lights is almost dazzling

12:58.090 --> 13:00.210
and she doesn't cast shadow.

13:04.570 --> 13:08.420
However, if it happens at night...

13:08.420 --> 13:12.690
Doesn’t it seem too much like a hoax, with a setting like a street light?

13:13.200 --> 13:18.030
Yes, even I think it is a silly rumor. 

13:18.030 --> 13:25.860
If there are vampires, I’d like to meet them.

13:25.860 --> 13:32.250
Let’s see, maybe meet them is not the thing.
It just would be nice if such superhuman beings existed.

13:32.250 --> 13:35.680
You mean like a god?

13:35.680 --> 13:39.150
It doesn’t have to be a god, though.

13:42.950 --> 13:46.980
Otherwise, nothing would really come out of it, right?

13:58.480 --> 14:00.260
Oh, my bad, my bad.

14:00.260 --> 14:03.870
Araragi-kun, unexpectedly you’re easy to talk with.

14:04.600 --> 14:09.550
I got carried away, I feel like I told you something that makes no sense.

14:11.570 --> 14:16.710
It is odd that you are easy to talk with, yet you don’t have friends. 

14:16.710 --> 14:19.130
Why don’t you make any?

14:20.740 --> 14:24.510
If you make friends, your strength as a person will decrease.

14:25.590 --> 14:26.440
Eh?

14:27.190 --> 14:30.060
I’m sorry, I don’t quite get what you mean.

14:30.060 --> 14:32.340
Well, you see, 

14:32.340 --> 14:34.690
it’s kinda like this...

14:35.280 --> 14:39.760
You see, if I had friends, I’d have to worry about them, right? 

14:39.760 --> 14:43.270
If my friends get hurt, even I would,

14:43.270 --> 14:46.180
and if they were sad, then I too would be sad. 

14:46.180 --> 14:50.340
Putting it that way, these weak points build up.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.840
And I'd grow even weaker as a person.

14:54.780 --> 14:59.090
but, if they have fun, then you’d have fun, 

14:59.090 --> 15:02.060
and if they’re happy, then you’re also happy, 

15:02.060 --> 15:05.450
Wouldn't the good points build up as well?

15:05.450 --> 15:09.380
No, I envy when friends are having fun, 

15:09.380 --> 15:12.340
and I’m jealous when friends are happy.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.420
Small minded.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.670
<i>fuck off m8</i>

15:26.710 --> 15:27.860
I’m...

15:27.860 --> 15:28.870
Huh?

15:28.870 --> 15:32.030
I'm going to head to the library now.

15:32.030 --> 15:34.290
Wanna come with me?

15:34.940 --> 15:36.090
Why?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.690
What are you gonna do there?

15:39.370 --> 15:41.520
Obviously, I’m going to study, what else?

15:42.410 --> 15:43.980
Obviously, you say...

15:44.880 --> 15:48.250
Sorry, but I’m not praiseworthy enough to study on my own,

15:48.250 --> 15:52.230
even without homework to do for Spring Break.

15:52.230 --> 15:56.320
But next year you will have exams, right?

15:56.320 --> 15:58.660
Exams? Whatever.

15:58.660 --> 16:02.230
I doubt I will even graduate. 

16:02.230 --> 16:04.570
I won’t make it in time no matter what.

16:05.410 --> 16:06.670
Hmm?

16:08.930 --> 16:12.010
Araragi, do you play Pokemon Go?

16:12.010 --> 16:14.500
Well, I do have a cellphone.

16:15.550 --> 16:16.720
Could I borrow it?

16:24.730 --> 16:25.600
Thanks.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.770
Here.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.500
I put my number and e-mail in there.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.850
{memem}

16:45.500 --> 16:47.620
Hanekawa Tsubasa

16:48.180 --> 16:49.640
Too bad!

16:49.640 --> 16:52.480
You made a friend!

17:35.660 --> 17:37.420
What's with her...?

20:25.260 --> 20:26.370
S.O.S.

20:25.260 --> 20:26.370
S.O.S.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.090
S.O.S.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.090
S.O.S.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.510
Thou!

23:50.950 --> 23:54.700
I will... let thee save me.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.320
Can thou hear me? 

23:58.960 --> 24:01.400
I am saying I will let thee help me.

24:02.010 --> 24:03.980
<i>fuck this line, i don't speak moonpanese</i>

24:13.900 --> 24:15.560
Hey,

24:15.560 --> 24:17.510
are you okay?!

24:20.880 --> 24:23.190
I’ll immediately call an ambulance

24:41.280 --> 24:45.310
Amboolens... I do not need it.

24:49.620 --> 24:54.070
Thus, give thy blood to me.

25:01.650 --> 25:04.480
<i>Araragi, do you believe in vampires?</i>

25:05.560 --> 25:14.450
They say it’s a blonde-haired, beautiful woman, 
 a vampire whose cold eyes could chill your spine.

25:14.450 --> 25:20.300
My name is Kissshot-Acerolaorion-Heartunderblade.

25:20.300 --> 25:24.960
The iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire.

25:26.090 --> 25:30.970
I will swallow thy blood to make it my flesh,

25:30.970 --> 25:35.310
so give thy blood to me.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.950
A vampire?

25:43.670 --> 25:46.970
Shouldn’t you be... immortal?

25:47.600 --> 25:49.750
I lost too much blood. 

25:50.440 --> 25:55.050
I cannot regenerate any more, nor shape-shift.

25:55.050 --> 25:58.310
At this rate, I will die here.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.930
A worthless human,

26:06.930 --> 26:10.350
should consider a honor to become my flesh.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.310
F-Flesh?

26:13.910 --> 26:16.590
Blood... couldn’t you do a transfusion?

26:19.770 --> 26:22.460
Ho-How much do you need?

26:23.160 --> 26:28.540
For the time being, with thy share I can endure this emergency...

26:28.540 --> 26:31.070
I see, my share...

26:44.330 --> 26:47.070
What is the matter?! Blood. Give me blood.

26:47.070 --> 26:51.250
Quickly, I say. Why are thou dozing off, thou dolt!

26:54.570 --> 26:58.250
No, no way... I should be able to escape.

26:59.990 --> 27:01.830
<i>I should be able to get away.</i>

27:14.130 --> 27:15.160
Hey!

27:19.650 --> 27:21.290
You're kididng, right?

27:25.500 --> 27:29.320
You aren't going to save me?

27:39.000 --> 27:42.010
No, no, no! 

27:42.010 --> 27:46.690
No, no, no! I do not want to die.

27:46.690 --> 27:49.440
I do not want to die! I do not want to die!

27:49.440 --> 27:52.860
Save me!
Save me, please!

27:58.050 --> 28:00.370
Please, I beg thee!

28:16.090 --> 28:23.650
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

28:23.650 --> 28:43.150
GOMENNASAI GOMENNASAI GOMENNASAI GOMENNASAI GOMENNASAI GOMENNASAI GOMENNASAI GOMENNASAI 

28:54.030 --> 28:56.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

29:28.210 --> 29:30.610
I’ll die.

29:32.090 --> 29:34.630
She’s a monster.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.250
A vampire.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.830
There is no need to save her!

29:44.090 --> 29:45.740
Right?!

29:57.530 --> 30:04.330
I know that already!{fFADE}

30:34.110 --> 30:35.830
Don't give up, stupid!

30:47.620 --> 30:49.870
C-Can I?

30:49.870 --> 30:53.530
Did you think you couldn't, you idiot?

30:55.850 --> 30:58.430
Shit, shit, shit!

30:59.610 --> 31:00.570
Why?

31:01.690 --> 31:04.100
Why did it turn out like this?

31:12.470 --> 31:16.550
I have never had a reason to keep living no matter what, 

31:17.880 --> 31:22.750
I have never had a reason to give priority to my life, even if I died,

31:23.930 --> 31:27.080
it won’t have any impact on the world.

31:29.330 --> 31:35.940
That's why, I'm gonna save you, with my blood.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.530
It’s all yours, all of it.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.030
Don’t leave a single drop.

31:48.780 --> 31:50.670
Thank thou.

32:57.580 --> 32:58.830
Just a dream...

33:29.930 --> 33:30.810
Hey.

33:32.410 --> 33:33.390
Wake up!

33:38.000 --> 33:39.340
5 more minutes...

33:41.000 --> 33:42.880
Come on, wake up!

33:42.880 --> 33:46.270
Not yet.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.060
How long do you want to sleep?!

33:55.130 --> 33:56.990
About 46 hundred million years.

33:59.690 --> 34:02.370
Another earth will arise!

34:08.510 --> 34:11.000
<i>Wait, isn’t it bad if I woke her up right now?</i>

34:50.250 --> 34:51.250
B L A C K

34:50.250 --> 34:51.250
B L A C K

34:50.440 --> 34:51.620
Idiot!

35:55.650 --> 35:57.150
B L A C K

35:55.650 --> 35:57.150
B L A C K

35:55.810 --> 35:57.150
Seriously...

36:00.720 --> 36:03.580
What kind of idiot would suddenly walk right under the sun?

36:03.580 --> 36:05.530
Dost thou have a death wish?

36:05.530 --> 36:10.200
A normal vampire would evaporate in an instant.

36:14.960 --> 36:18.720
Don’t let there be another time where you go out when the sun is there.

36:18.720 --> 36:26.790
Having immortal powers, you’ll burn,
regenerate, burn, regenerate in an eternal loop.

36:37.750 --> 36:43.780
Well, that is what it means to be an immortal vampire.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.520
Vampire?

36:49.730 --> 36:52.510
Then... you are...

36:54.450 --> 36:55.330
B L A C K

36:54.450 --> 36:55.330
B L A C K

36:55.830 --> 37:04.770
Yes. It is I, Kissshot-Acerolaorion-Heartunder-Blade.

37:04.770 --> 37:07.590
You can just call me Heartunder-Blade.

37:09.730 --> 37:14.280
I’ve only created two subordinates in four hundred years...

37:14.280 --> 37:18.470
Looking at your regeneration powers, 

37:18.470 --> 37:20.350
you turned out pretty good. 

37:21.350 --> 37:22.490
S-Subordinate?

37:22.490 --> 37:25.000
Yes, so thou!

37:28.250 --> 37:32.830
Now that I think about it, I still don’t know thy name.

37:36.010 --> 37:37.360
Well, whatever.

37:37.360 --> 37:42.450
The name you had up till now, doesn’t hold much meaning to the you now. 

37:43.230 --> 37:44.970
Anyways, servant.

37:46.850 --> 37:50.140
Welcome to the Night World.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.730
Where... where are we?

38:24.080 --> 38:27.790
Indeed, although I call this place a cram school

38:27.790 --> 38:32.530
it closed down a few years ago already.

38:32.530 --> 38:36.210
And since it’s now just a ruin, it became convenient for hiding.

38:36.210 --> 38:37.950
Hm...

38:37.950 --> 38:40.700
Then, Kissshot, next question...

38:40.700 --> 38:45.890
Wait! Didn’t I tell you to call me Heartunder-Blade?!

38:45.890 --> 38:48.220
That's so long, though.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.480
Kissshot is shorter... 

38:51.060 --> 38:54.010
Or can I not call you that?

38:55.910 --> 38:57.510
No.

38:57.510 --> 38:59.330
Well, fine, 

38:59.330 --> 39:02.400
you can call me whatever you want.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.540
I have no reason to refuse.

39:06.450 --> 39:07.640
Then,

39:07.640 --> 39:10.250
what's your next question?

39:10.250 --> 39:11.990
Well,

39:11.990 --> 39:16.570
did I really become a vampire?

39:16.570 --> 39:18.320
Of course you did.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.220
There is no point in explaining now,

39:21.220 --> 39:25.620
thou art my subordinate, my servant. 

39:25.620 --> 39:27.080
Be honoured.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.500
Servant...

39:30.240 --> 39:35.620
Then, why the fuck do you look like a loli?

39:35.620 --> 39:40.220
Last night... When I met you... you looked like an adult.

39:41.370 --> 39:43.690
Well, I'm <i>sorry </i>that I look like a child!

39:43.690 --> 39:46.070
No, I didn't mean it like that!

39:56.380 --> 39:59.770
Thy blood, I sucked it all.

39:59.770 --> 40:02.710
But this degree wasn’t enough,

40:02.710 --> 40:06.220
that’s why, we became connected.

40:06.220 --> 40:08.760
Even with that I only kept my life. 

40:08.760 --> 40:12.370
With that said, I kept the minimal degree of immortality, 

40:12.370 --> 40:16.460
the majority of vampire powers became limited.

40:16.460 --> 40:18.770
So inconvenient.

40:21.930 --> 40:26.710
My limbs are like this, only the shape regrew.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.550
Well, the insides are empty,

40:30.550 --> 40:33.910
with that being said, it should be no problem...

40:33.910 --> 40:35.260
However, 

40:35.260 --> 40:40.360
the master-servant relationship needs to be clear, servant!

40:40.360 --> 40:46.260
Even though I’m like this, I’m a vampire that has lived for 500 years.

40:46.260 --> 40:49.430
The master servant relationship should be clear,

40:49.430 --> 40:53.790
you being turned into a vampire just recently, should never speak with a peer-like speech.

40:53.790 --> 40:55.390
Ha-huh...

40:55.390 --> 40:58.650
Huh, an ambiguous answer...

40:58.650 --> 41:01.310
Do you <i>really</i> understand?

41:01.310 --> 41:03.700
Umm, yeah, I understand.

41:03.700 --> 41:08.490
Then as a sign of obedience to me, rub my head!

41:21.010 --> 41:22.510
That's enough.

41:22.510 --> 41:24.100
B L A C K

41:22.510 --> 41:24.100
B L A C K

41:33.420 --> 41:34.300
Why,

41:35.210 --> 41:37.210
did you turn me into a vampire?

41:38.490 --> 41:41.570
I had the determination to be killed, 

41:41.570 --> 41:43.680
when you sucked my blood.

41:44.350 --> 41:45.470
It's nothing special.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.620
After your blood gets sucked by a vampire, 

41:47.620 --> 41:52.870
you’ll turn into a vampire.

41:52.870 --> 41:54.570
That's all there is to it.

41:54.570 --> 41:57.560
I see.

41:57.560 --> 42:02.040
Well, to me this is just right, do you know why?

42:02.590 --> 42:06.270
To thee, it is something you have to do.

42:07.150 --> 42:12.480
Although thy blood by itself allowed my body to recover,

42:12.480 --> 42:15.630
the me right now, is far from full power.

42:15.630 --> 42:19.870
So from now on, thou must taketh action.

42:21.130 --> 42:22.980
<i>Me? Action?</i>

42:30.670 --> 42:31.770
I...

42:34.430 --> 42:35.530
I...

42:36.740 --> 42:38.670
can't turn back into a human?!

42:42.400 --> 42:44.800
That’s what I thought.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.260
I understand why thou wouldst have these feelings.

42:47.260 --> 42:49.860
Then, what can I do? I—

42:49.730 --> 42:50.600
B L A C K

42:49.730 --> 42:50.600
B L A C K

42:49.860 --> 42:50.940
You can...

42:52.440 --> 42:53.860
turn back.

42:54.490 --> 42:56.410
I swear on me momma.

43:22.890 --> 43:27.670
Those three people specialize in exorcising vampires, they make a living by killing those like me.

43:27.670 --> 43:30.680
Then, we need to defeat them?

43:30.680 --> 43:32.600
What kind of idiot talk is that?

43:32.600 --> 43:34.600
Do you have a death wish? 

43:34.600 --> 43:37.930
Although the point about having my limbs taken away is heartbreaking. 

43:37.930 --> 43:40.610
I don’t have much regeneration power left,

43:41.170 --> 43:44.340
in this situation, how can I fight?

43:44.340 --> 43:45.410
Like I said...

43:46.910 --> 43:49.580
I just need thou to face those three people,

43:49.580 --> 43:53.530
and retrieve my limbs.

43:59.950 --> 44:03.770
It can’t possibly be that easy?

44:03.770 --> 44:09.530
If thou wants to turn back into a human,
I need to have my full power restored.

44:09.530 --> 44:12.130
Basically, back to my complete form.

44:12.710 --> 44:17.340
For that, my limbs are needed.

44:19.030 --> 44:24.290
But I’m no good with things like fighting.

44:24.290 --> 44:27.550
Won’t I get exorcised?

44:27.550 --> 44:33.080
Idiot, thy weakness only applied when thou wast still Human.

44:33.080 --> 44:36.040
Thou right now art my subordinate.

44:36.040 --> 44:39.980
Though thou art weak, 

44:39.980 --> 44:45.290
in my current state thou couldst easily overpower me.

44:45.290 --> 44:49.910
So basically, even though you’re a Vampire, you’re weak? 

44:49.910 --> 44:51.440
Not at all!

45:05.360 --> 45:10.870
Hmm, even if the presently weakened you isn’t as strong as me...

45:10.870 --> 45:18.290
You’re stronger than me at full power and yet those three men were
able to take away limbs from the you in complete form?

45:18.290 --> 45:21.790
I was ambushed by those three people. 

45:21.790 --> 45:23.640
I underestimated them.

45:25.450 --> 45:27.190
Basically,

45:27.190 --> 45:30.120
as long as you fight them one on one,

45:30.120 --> 45:32.980
you should be able to take them on.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.590
Honestly, 

45:34.590 --> 45:36.370
it'll be easy.

47:05.100 --> 47:06.650
What should I do?

48:10.560 --> 48:14.420
What, what are you people saying?!

48:14.420 --> 48:16.310
I’m just a human!

48:16.830 --> 48:20.710
Are you guys just gonna kill me like that?!

49:18.390 --> 49:22.290
You are really energetic,

49:22.290 --> 49:25.250
did something good happen?

49:25.040 --> 49:26.750
B L A C K

49:25.040 --> 49:26.750
B L A C K

49:31.820 --> 49:32.630
Huh?

49:43.900 --> 49:44.930
Thank you.

49:45.490 --> 49:46.670
You saved my ass there.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.080
No need to thank me.

49:49.080 --> 49:52.530
I saw you were alone, so I helped, Araragi.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.150
That's all.

50:05.050 --> 50:08.090
No need to be so alert around me.

50:08.090 --> 50:12.080
You are really energetic, did something good happen?

50:17.230 --> 50:21.000
Well, in any case, let’s go home first, Araragi.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.600
Go home?!

50:24.940 --> 50:27.660
I mean to that cram school ruin.

50:28.540 --> 50:29.200
He?

50:31.640 --> 50:33.270
Wait a minute.

50:33.270 --> 50:35.360
How do you know about that?!

50:35.360 --> 50:38.020
Hm? Of course I know.

50:38.020 --> 50:42.650
It was me who introduced the place to that child.

50:44.700 --> 50:48.470
Well, as they say: If you have Honor, you have Bravery.

50:49.100 --> 50:55.820
That child, Heart-under-Blade, was dragging your body,

50:55.820 --> 50:58.310
so I told her about the place.

51:00.150 --> 51:03.530
You, what kind of person are you?

51:04.090 --> 51:07.340
Me? I’m just an old man
who passed by, that’s all.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.960
Relax,

51:12.960 --> 51:17.170
I’m not a vampire exorcizing specialist.

51:17.170 --> 51:21.990
Although it’s not like I know nothing about vampires.

51:21.990 --> 51:25.750
Though, my specialty is much broader. 

51:27.980 --> 51:30.520
You're back!

51:31.350 --> 51:32.710
Huh?

51:32.710 --> 51:36.160
The guy behind... I think I've seen him before?

51:36.160 --> 51:39.560
That's mean. You don't even remember me?

51:40.770 --> 51:43.910
Well? How did it go?

51:52.700 --> 51:54.700
Huh.

51:54.700 --> 51:56.230
Those three,

51:56.230 --> 51:58.420
it’s troublesome that they’re still working together. 

51:58.420 --> 52:04.900
Anyway, you said you couldn’t defeat
those three people even at full strength.

52:04.900 --> 52:09.450
Then how could I, your subordinate, stand a chance?

52:09.450 --> 52:10.920
Like I said, 

52:10.920 --> 52:12.280
just fight them one by one!

52:12.280 --> 52:15.510
That's impossible, they cooperate.

52:15.510 --> 52:19.530
You said it was okay to just dillydally here,

52:19.530 --> 52:22.520
but even here, sooner or later they’ll find us. 

52:21.510 --> 52:23.660
<i>There’s no need to worry about that.</i>

52:24.120 --> 52:30.390
While you guys were sleeping I had set up a barrier here.

52:31.050 --> 52:32.510
Barrier?

52:32.510 --> 52:34.670
Something like a force-field?

52:34.670 --> 52:36.830
You can call it that.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.130
You, 

52:39.930 --> 52:41.830
what exactly is your goal?

52:41.830 --> 52:46.030
Why would you help Kissshot and me?

52:46.830 --> 52:53.110
I know you’re not one of them, but are you really one of us? 

52:58.060 --> 53:00.990
You're being really mean.

53:00.990 --> 53:04.450
I want to achieve a balance.

53:04.450 --> 53:07.670
That is to say, it is my job.

53:07.670 --> 53:10.250
Communication between here and there.

53:11.580 --> 53:13.810
You made a self-introduction,

53:13.810 --> 53:15.840
didn't you say you would go on?

53:20.220 --> 53:24.880
Oshino Meme. A free man of no residence.

53:24.880 --> 53:29.020
Well, it'just think that I'm an authority in terms of monster.

53:30.480 --> 53:35.980
Thouh, I'm not like those 3 people, I’m not great with monster exorcizing.

53:35.980 --> 53:37.590
What do you mean “Not great”?

53:38.370 --> 53:42.680
To put it simply, I don't like it.

53:42.680 --> 53:46.000
But you're not a specialist?

53:46.000 --> 53:49.300
I <i>am</i> a specialist, that’s why I help to maintain the balance.

53:49.300 --> 53:53.070
I negotiate. 

53:53.070 --> 53:56.010
Essentially, I’m a middle-man.

53:56.860 --> 53:57.900
<i>Negotiation?</i>

53:58.850 --> 54:01.890
<i>Here and there - connecting?</i>

54:03.680 --> 54:05.130
<i>What is </i>here<i> and </i>there<i>?</i>

54:05.690 --> 54:07.220
<i>Where is <i>here</i> and where is <i>there</i>?</i>

54:07.870 --> 54:11.100
<i></i>Here<i> probably refers to humans, </i>there<i> to monsters.</i>

54:15.260 --> 54:17.960
Monster?
Great.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.290
I prefer to call it Kaii.

54:22.260 --> 54:26.180
And that child sitting here, she is the Kaii Killer.

54:26.180 --> 54:30.830
A rare type of vampire that can absorb energy from Kaii.

54:30.830 --> 54:34.610
<i>idk what line again, i dont speak taiwanese</i>

54:35.010 --> 54:36.010
B L A C K

54:35.010 --> 54:36.010
B L A C K

54:37.890 --> 54:42.630
Listening to the conversion you guys just had, 

54:43.190 --> 54:46.680
it seems like this matter is particulary serious. 

54:46.680 --> 54:50.030
I couldn’t have imagined that something so troublesome would happen.

54:50.030 --> 54:53.460
It is not troublesome at all. It is very simple.

54:53.460 --> 54:58.610
To a vampire that can live for a long time, it may be simple.

54:59.680 --> 55:02.750
But for us humans it is very difficult.

55:02.750 --> 55:04.870
Right, Araragi?

55:10.130 --> 55:14.360
Moreover, I’m interested in you, Heart-under-Blade.

55:14.870 --> 55:21.920
It’s interesting that you’re willing to turn Araragi back into a human. I’m interested in this point.

55:32.880 --> 55:36.540
From this perspective, I can stay on the middle-ground.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.360
Middle-ground?

55:41.090 --> 55:43.320
You mean between us and the others?

55:43.320 --> 55:44.850
There’s no other.

55:46.710 --> 55:49.470
Can you help us?

55:49.470 --> 55:52.250
I’m not helping you.

55:52.760 --> 55:58.740
I’m only lending you my strength.

55:58.740 --> 56:01.330
Right now, the balance is off. 

56:02.350 --> 56:08.340
Ahh, but of course, this is a job so it can’t be free of charge.

56:08.850 --> 56:10.670
Right, payment...

56:10.670 --> 56:13.840
How about two million yen?

56:10.740 --> 56:13.840
Note: around 6,860,000.00 zimbabwean dollars

56:14.380 --> 56:15.790
Two million?!

56:15.790 --> 56:18.540
I won’t press about when to pay.

56:18.540 --> 56:20.910
But I don’t lend my strength for free. 

56:20.910 --> 56:24.090
Without this, there won’t be balance.

56:26.110 --> 56:27.380
But...

56:29.920 --> 56:32.810
So, can I hear your plan?

56:35.730 --> 56:38.950
You say you’re a negotiator but it isn’t that easy.

56:38.950 --> 56:42.310
You won’t retrieve my limbs from them.

56:42.310 --> 56:50.430
I wouldn’t even think about it. Besides, I don’t know the plan yet.

56:50.430 --> 56:55.010
It’s possible that I can do it. 
I’ll bow my head and ask nicely.

56:55.010 --> 56:59.000
Fortunately for us, this game can be solved with words and words alone.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.110
Game? You think this is a motherfucking game?

57:03.580 --> 57:13.130
First of all, we’ll need to split them up.
It shouldn’t be a problem if we do it one-on-one.

57:13.130 --> 57:18.180
Though, even you can’t read their moves, Heart-under-Blade. So I’ll need to find a way to do that.

57:18.180 --> 57:24.010
But, brat, how are you going to negotiate with those three people?

57:24.010 --> 57:30.080
Ask while bowing my head - They’re an easygoing bunch.

57:30.080 --> 57:34.760
And then Araragi will then handle retrieving your limbs.

57:35.730 --> 57:46.530
If he can safely return your arms and legs, you can return to your completed form then, Araragi will be free to return to humanity.

57:49.010 --> 57:50.700
Hey, servant.

57:51.810 --> 57:59.990
I didn’t bring any human currency. I’m not even certain what kind of amount two million yen is.

57:59.990 --> 58:03.540
I’ll leave that debt to you.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.580
Don’t worry. 

58:08.580 --> 58:11.330
This brat’s skills are real.

58:11.330 --> 58:15.180
This I can assure you.

58:17.340 --> 58:22.790
I don’t have much money saved,

58:22.790 --> 58:27.050
but if you won’t press me on it, 

58:28.030 --> 58:29.690
I’ll bear the debt!

58:31.340 --> 58:33.640
Well, it’s decided. 

58:34.570 --> 58:36.030
Haha, thank you for your patronage.

58:36.620 --> 58:37.610
xd

58:37.610 --> 58:39.960
